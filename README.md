# Data Structures Lab Programs

This repository contains a comprehensive set of programs written as part of the **Data Structures Lab** coursework. It includes both the **implementation** and **application** of key data structures, written in C/C++.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Linear Data Structures
- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks (Array and Linked List based)
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Deque, Priority Queue)

### 🔹 Non-linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal)

### 🔹 Hashing
- Hash Tables with Collision Handling (Chaining, Open Addressing)

### 🔹 Applications
- Infix to Postfix conversion using Stack
- Expression Evaluation
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Graph traversal & shortest path algorithms
- Queue simulation, Stack backtracking, etc.

## 🛠️ How to Use
